            <p><b>YOUR ACCOUNT AND YOUR USER INFORMATION</b></p>
            <p>Some of the Services are only available if you create an account.  When any of the Services require you to open an account (“<b>Your Account</b>”) or to otherwise provide user or registration information, including user names and passwords (“<b>Your User Information</b>”), you must complete the registration process by providing UMG and/or Taylor Nation with complete, current, and accurate information and must update Your User Information to keep it complete, current, and accurate. By registering, you agree that you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your Account. Parties may assume that any communications they receive under Your Account have been made by you. You grant to the Parties the right to use, store, monitor, retrieve and transmit Your User Information in connection with the operation of and/or the provision of any of the Services.  Our information collection and use policies with respect to the privacy of Your User Information are set forth in the Sites’ Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference for all purposes. You agree that information submitted to Your Account will be transmitted to and shared with third parties that may be located in other countries in order for the Parties to provide services to you, including, but not limited to, transaction processing and fraud prevention.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your User Information.  You are also solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under Your Account or Your User Information.  You must notify UMG immediately, via e-mail to <a href="mailto:%2520customercare@umgstores.com">customercare@umgstores.com</a>, of any suspected or actual unauthorized use of Your Account or Your User Information, and of any and all other security breaches. You understand and agree that UMG and/or Taylor Nation may require you to provide information that may be used to confirm your identity and help ensure the security of your account.</p>
            <p>UMG and/or Taylor Nation will not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or lawyers’ fees that you may incur as a result of someone else using Your Account, either with or without your knowledge and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have or have not advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses and lawyers’ fees incurred by UMG Taylor Nation, or a third party due to someone else using Your Account.</p>
            <p>UMG and Taylor Nation each reserve the right to limit, block, suspend, or terminate Your Account in whole or in part or to refuse services to you, without notice to you, at any time and for any or no reason. Without limiting the above, if you are a repeat copyright infringer, UMG and/or Taylor Nation will, in appropriate circumstances, permanently terminate Your Account and remove all of Your Content from the Services.  If appropriate, in their sole discretion, UMG and/or Taylor Nation may communicate to other users that Your Account has been terminated, blocked, suspended, or terminated, and why this action has been taken. You have the right to terminate Your Account at any time.  You may terminate Your Account by following the instructions on the Services. Please note that if Your Account is terminated, UMG and Taylor Nation do not have an obligation to delete or return to you any of Your Content.</p>
            <p>If you voluntarily terminate Your Account or allow Your Account to lapse, you may reactivate Your Account at any time through the account interface on the Services.  Accounts terminated by us for any type of abuse, including without limitation, a violation of these Terms, may not be reactivated.  Certain provisions of these Terms will still apply post termination.</p>
            <p><b>FEES THAT YOU MAY PAY</b></p>
            <p>Some of the Services require you to pay a fee, the details of which are available in various areas of the Services that allow you to purchase products or services.  If you choose to join a mobile marketing list, please be aware that there are usually costs associated with receiving SMS or MMS messages, which are determined by your carrier. You should contact your carrier to determine the charges that may apply before you sign up to receive updates via SMS or MMS. If you wish to stop receiving such messages from us, at any time, simply write “STOP” in a reply to any message from UMG or Taylor Nation. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using Your Account or Your User Information.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>By submitting an order through the Services, you agree to pay in advance the price of the product(s) or service(s) ordered, plus any applicable taxes, shipping and handling and/or other charges. Payment may be made by credit card or any other method of payment made available to you (each, a “Method of Payment”). In order to make a payment, you must provide valid credit card and/or other billing information and authorize UMG (or any third party payment service provider engaged by UMG) to charge your Method of Payment for all orders placed and accepted via the Services.</p>
            <p>UMG may revise the pricing for products and services offered through the Services at any time.  Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in U.S. Dollars. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes payable.  If there is a dispute regarding payment of fees for products or services provided by us, Your Account may be closed and Your User Information may be disabled, without warning or notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THE <a href="https://store.taylorswift.com/pages/customer-support">CUSTOMER SUPPORT POLICIES</a> (IF AND WHEN APPLICABLE), YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY APPLICABLE FEES AND OTHER CHARGES FOR FEE-BASED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR THROUGH YOUR USER INFORMATION, INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES.</p>
            <p>UMG may, from time to time, modify, amend or supplement its fees and fee-billing methods, and such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting in these Terms or elsewhere on the Services.</p>
            <p>UMG reserves the right to refuse or limit any order you place with the webstore. UMG may also, in its sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, household, or order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same account, Method of Payment, email address, and/or using the same billing and/or shipping address. UMG also reserves the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in its sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors. In the event UMG makes a change to or cancel an order, it will attempt to notify you by contacting the email address provided at the time the order was made. If UMG cancels all or any part of your order after your Method of Payment has been charged, it will refund the appropriate amount.</p>
            <p><b>SUBMISSION OF YOUR IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>

            <p><b>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</b></p>
            <p><b>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</b></p>
            <p>You and the Parties agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between  you and either or both of the Parties, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between  you and either or both of the Parties, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to your use of the Services); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms or agreement to arbitrate. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p>
            <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with the Parties as follows:</p>
            <p>Initial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach the Parties’ support department at <a href="mailto:legalnotices@umusic.com">legalnotices@umusic.com</a>. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Parties’ support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
            <p>Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms' or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com ); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, One Atlantic Center, 1201 West Peachtree, NW, Suite 2650, Atlanta, GA 30309; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to UMG Commercial Services, Inc. Attn: General Counsel, EVP of Business &amp; Legal Affairs, 2220 Colorado Avenue, Santa Monica, California 90404, or Taylor Nation, LLC, 242 West Main Street, PMB 412, Hendersonville, TN 37075 if appropriate.</p>
            <p>You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, the relevant Parties will pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>
            <p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America. You and Parties further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
            <p><i>Class Action Waiver:</i> The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. <b>YOU AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
            <p><i>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims:</i> Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>
            <p><i>30-Day Right to Opt Out:</i> You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you used to register for your account) written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="mailto:legalnotices@umusic.com">legalnotices@umusic.com</a> with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Service or the effective date of the first set of Terms containing an Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, the Parties also will not be bound by them.</p>
            <p><i>Changes to This Section:</i> the Parties will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Service, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Service or sent to you.</p>
            <p>Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Service.</p>
            <p><i>Survival:</i> This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service.</p>
