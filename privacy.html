                    counting the number of users who have visited these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web
                    beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to
                    let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer
                    hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail. We, or our third party partners,
                    may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you.
